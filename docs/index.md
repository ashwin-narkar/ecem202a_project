# Abstract

In this project, I will be using Software Defined Radios to create a spatial radar-like detection system for various radio sources and eventually objects in a defined space. I will be using GNU radio to intially triangulate a cellphone in 2d, and eventually move to detecting breathing and heartbeat using an SDR.
